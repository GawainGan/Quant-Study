# Step 2 - Delay & Decay function:
1. **Delay** - Timing of the data: 
   - **Delay 0**: Today's Price
   - **Delay 1**: Yesterday's Price
2. **Decay** - A linear decay function over the past n days that combines today's value with previous days' decayed value. This function helps in removing major fluctuations or outliers in the alpha values on any given day. Decay is beneficial if you want to use the previous day's Alpha value.
3. **Function**: 
We call it either *Decayed Linear* or *Decayed Average*
$$
\text{Decayed Average} = \frac{T0's \text{ price } \times n(\text{days}) + T0-1's \text{ price } \times n(\text{days}) + \dots + T0-n-1's \text{ price } \times n(\text{days})}{n + (n-1) + \dots + 1}
$$

**Analysis:**
1. **Delay** - The concept of delay is accurate. It refers to the timing of the data. "Delay 0" represents the current day's price, while "Delay 1" represents the previous day's price. This is a standard terminology used in quantitative finance to refer to the timing of data points.
2. **Decay** - A decay function, especially a linear one, is used to give more weight to recent data points and less weight to older ones. This is particularly useful in financial time series analysis where recent data might be more relevant for predicting future movements.
3. **Function** - The function provided is a representation of a linear decay function. It calculates a weighted average of prices over a given number of days, where more recent prices are given higher weights. The formula is mathematically sound and is commonly used in quantitative finance for smoothing purposes.


The information provided is accurate and aligns with standard quantitative finance concepts. The decay function is a useful tool in time series analysis, especially when dealing with financial data, as it helps in giving more importance to recent data points.


# Real-world scenarios
### Case 1: Momentum Trading Strategy
**Background:** 
A momentum trading strategy aims to capitalize on the continuation of existing trends in the market. Traders look for securities that are moving significantly in one direction on high volume and try to jump on board to ride the momentum train.

**Method 1 (Using the Decay Function):**
To determine the momentum of a stock, we can calculate the decayed average of returns over the past 5 days.

```python
# Given closing prices
closing_prices = [125.07, 126.36, 125.02, 129.62, 130.15]

# Method 1: Decayed Average of Returns
def decayed_average(prices, n):
    total_weight = sum(range(1, n+1))
    weighted_sum = sum(prices[i] * (n-i) for i in range(n))
    return weighted_sum / total_weight

decayed_returns = decayed_average(closing_prices, 5)
print("Decayed Average of Returns:", decayed_returns)
```

**Method 2 (Using Raw Returns):**
Calculate the daily returns for the stock using the formula:
$$ \text{Return} = \frac{\text{Today's Price} - \text{Yesterday's Price}}{\text{Yesterday's Price}} $$

```python
# Method 2: Raw Returns
raw_returns = [(closing_prices[i] - closing_prices[i-1]) / closing_prices[i-1] for i in range(1, len(closing_prices))]
print("Raw Returns:", raw_returns)
```

**Discussion:** 
Using the decay function provides a smoothed value of returns, which can help in identifying the underlying trend without getting affected by daily fluctuations. On the other hand, raw returns give a direct measure of daily price changes. Depending on the trading strategy, a trader might prefer one method over the other. For instance, a short-term trader might rely more on raw returns, while a medium-term trader might find the decayed average more useful.

### Case 2: Portfolio Diversification
**Background:** 
Diversification is a risk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. The rationale behind this technique contends that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher returns and pose a lower risk than any individual investment found within the portfolio.

**Method (Using the Decay Function):**
To determine the weight of each asset in a diversified portfolio, we can use the decay function to give more importance to assets that have been performing well recently.

```python
# Given closing prices of two assets
asset1_prices = [105.07, 106.36, 105.02, 109.62, 110.15]
asset2_prices = [95.07, 96.36, 95.02, 99.62, 100.15]

# Calculate decayed average for both assets
asset1_decayed = decayed_average(asset1_prices, 5)
asset2_decayed = decayed_average(asset2_prices, 5)

# Determine weights based on decayed averages
total_decayed = asset1_decayed + asset2_decayed
weight_asset1 = asset1_decayed / total_decayed
weight_asset2 = asset2_decayed / total_decayed

print("Weight of Asset 1:", weight_asset1)
print("Weight of Asset 2:", weight_asset2)
```

**Discussion:** 
Using the decay function to determine portfolio weights ensures that assets that have been performing well recently get a higher allocation. This can be beneficial in a momentum-driven market. However, it's essential to rebalance the portfolio periodically to ensure diversification.

### Case 3: Alpha Signal Generation for Algorithmic Trading
**Background:** 
Alpha signals are used in algorithmic trading to predict future price movements. These signals can be generated using various methods, including technical indicators, machine learning models, and statistical methods.

**Method (Using the Decay Function):**
To generate an alpha signal, we can calculate the decayed average of price changes over the past n days. If the decayed average is positive, it indicates a buy signal, and if it's negative, it indicates a sell signal.

```python
# Given closing prices
closing_prices = [45.07, 46.36, 45.02, 49.62, 50.15]

# Calculate decayed average
alpha_signal = decayed_average(closing_prices, 5)

# Determine buy or sell signal
if alpha_signal > 0:
    print("Buy Signal")
else:
    print("Sell Signal")
```

**Discussion:** 
Using the decay function to generate alpha signals can help in capturing short-term price movements. However, it's essential to combine this with other indicators and risk management techniques to ensure profitable trading.

**Note:** The above scenarios use simulated data and are for illustrative purposes. In real-world applications, it's crucial to use actual data and consider various other factors before making trading decisions.
