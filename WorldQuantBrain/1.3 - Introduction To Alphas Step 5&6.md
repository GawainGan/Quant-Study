### 1.3 - Introduction To Alphas Step 5&6
# Step 5: Simulation Duration
The duration chosen to backtest an Alpha idea is crucial. A recommended window is at least five years for the simulation.
    
Analysis:
The concept of Simulation Duration is accurate. Backtesting over a longer duration, like five years, provides a more comprehensive view of how a strategy would have performed under different market conditions. It helps in identifying potential pitfalls and ensures that the strategy isn't tailored to a specific short-term market anomaly.

## Real-world scenarios
### **Case: Backtesting a Trading Strategy**
**Background:** 
Backtesting is a key component in the development of a trading strategy. It involves testing a strategy on historical data to see how it would have performed. This helps in understanding the potential risks and rewards of the strategy.

**Method 1 (Using Simulation Duration):**
A trader wants to backtest a momentum strategy on a specific stock. They decide to use a simulation duration of five years to ensure that the strategy is tested across different market conditions.

**Python Code for Backtesting with Simulation Duration:**
```python
# First, let's re-run the initial code to generate the historical prices and set up the plotting libraries.

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Setting a seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)

# Parameters for the simulation
initial_price = 100  # Starting price of the stock
days = 1260  # 5 years of trading days
daily_returns = np.random.normal(0.0005, 0.02, days) + 1  # Mean daily return and volatility

# Generate simulated price data using random walk
historical_prices = [initial_price]
for i in range(1, days):
    price = historical_prices[-1] * daily_returns[i]
    historical_prices.append(price)

# Now, let's re-run the momentum strategy to get the Buy/Sell positions
positions = []
for i in range(5, len(historical_prices)):
    if historical_prices[i] > historical_prices[i-5]:
        positions.append('Buy')
    else:
        positions.append('Sell')

# Finally, plot the simulated historical prices and Buy/Sell signals
plt.figure(figsize=(18,6))
plt.plot(historical_prices, label="Stock Price")
plt.title("Simulated Historical Stock Prices Over 5 Years with Buy/Sell Signals")
plt.xlabel("Days")
plt.ylabel("Stock Price")
plt.grid(True)

# Annotate the buy/sell positions on the plot
for i, position in enumerate(positions[::30]):  # Taking every 30th position for annotation
    if position == 'Buy':
        plt.annotate('Buy', (i*30+5, historical_prices[i*30+5]), color='g', fontsize=8)
    else:
        plt.annotate('Sell', (i*30+5, historical_prices[i*30+5]), color='r', fontsize=8)

plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
Output:

**Alternative Method:**
Instead of a fixed five-year duration, the trader could use a rolling window backtest where the strategy is tested on a fixed window (e.g., one year) that rolls through the entire dataset.

**Potential Outcomes:**
Using a rolling window might provide insights into how the strategy performs in shorter time frames and might highlight periods where the strategy underperforms.

# Step 6: Lookback Days
Alpha ideas typically use past information to generate the current day's position. The number of lookback days should be set greater than or equal to the days the Alpha looks back in the past.

**Analysis:**
The concept of Lookback Days is accurate. In quantitative strategies, the lookback period is the time frame over which past data points are considered for a current calculation. Setting an appropriate lookback period is crucial as it determines how much historical data the strategy will consider, which can impact its predictions and performance.


## Real-world scenarios
### **Case: Incorporating Lookback Days in a Moving Average Strategy**
**Background:** 
Moving averages are popular tools in technical analysis. They help in identifying trends by averaging prices over a specific number of days.

**Method 1 (Using Lookback Days):**
A trader wants to use a 50-day moving average strategy. This means they need to look back 50 days to calculate the average for any given day.

**Python Code for Moving Average with Lookback Days:**

**Step 1 - 50-day Moving Average Calculation**
```python
# Given the simulated historical_prices
LOOKBACK_DAYS = 50
# Calculate 50-day moving average
moving_averages = []
for i in range(LOOKBACK_DAYS, len(historical_prices)):
    avg = sum(historical_prices[i-LOOKBACK_DAYS:i]) / LOOKBACK_DAYS
    moving_averages.append(avg)
```

**Step 2 - Momentum Strategy with Moving Average**
- Generate Buy/Sell signals based on the stock's price in relation to its 50-day moving average. 
- If the stock price is above its moving average, it indicates upward momentum, and we generate a 'Buy' signal. 
- Conversely, if the stock price is below its moving average, it indicates downward momentum, and we generate a 'Sell' signal.

```python
positions = []
for i in range(len(moving_averages)):
    if historical_prices[i+LOOKBACK_DAYS] > moving_averages[i]:
        positions.append('Buy')
    else:
        positions.append('Sell')
```
**Step 3 - Visualization**
plot the simulated historical prices, 50-day moving average, and Buy/Sell signals.
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(18,6))
plt.plot(historical_prices, label="Stock Price", alpha=0.8)
plt.plot(range(LOOKBACK_DAYS, len(historical_prices)), moving_averages, label="50-day Moving Average", color='orange', linestyle='--')
plt.title("Simulated Historical Stock Prices with 50-day Moving Average and Buy/Sell Signals")
plt.xlabel("Days")
plt.ylabel("Stock Price")
plt.grid(True)

# Annotate the buy/sell positions on the plot
for i, position in enumerate(positions[::30]):  # Taking every 30th position for clarity
    if position == 'Buy':
        plt.annotate('Buy', (i*30+LOOKBACK_DAYS, historical_prices[i*30+LOOKBACK_DAYS]), color='g', fontsize=8, verticalalignment='bottom')
    else:
        plt.annotate('Sell', (i*30+LOOKBACK_DAYS, historical_prices[i*30+LOOKBACK_DAYS]), color='r', fontsize=8, verticalalignment='top')
plt.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

**Alternative Method:**
Instead of a simple moving average, the trader could use an exponential moving average (EMA) which gives more weight to recent prices.

**Potential Outcomes:**
Using an EMA might react faster to recent price changes, making it more suitable for volatile markets. However, it might also produce more false signals compared to a simple moving average.
